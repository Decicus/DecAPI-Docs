          description: "How many VODs to offset when retrieving the VOD information. Default: 0."
      notes:
        - 'The VOD replay endpoint retrieves the latest VOD (in relation to the <code>offset</code>), takes the specified amount of <code>minutes</code> and returns a timestamped URL. Example: If the streamer has been streaming for roughly 2 hours and 25 minutes and the minutes specified is 15, the URL will be linking to 2 hours and 10 minutes into the VOD.'
        - '<strong>Keep in mind that VOD lengths are not fully updated in realtime, and might be "lagging" a few minutes behind the length of the livestream.</strong>'
